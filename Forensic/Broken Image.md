# Challenge
Can you retrieve the flag from this broken image?
[logo.png](./files/logo.png)

# Solution
The image seems to be corrupt and it won't open in any image viewer, you can open the image with any text editor instead of opening it in an image viewer and since we know the flag format use the find option to search for `hexaCTF` and it will get you the flag.
